# dijkstra

Modified dijkstra to find the path with the lowest weight in an undirected graph.

"Carrier K. transports calibrated high precision
measuring instruments from his home city to various cities in a mountainous country. If the carrier
takes the instruments to a too high altitude during the transport, they must be re-calibrated. Thus,
when K. takes a transport task, he wants to know which route to destination has its highest point as
low as possible. For this, all route options are formulated as an undirected graph, whose nodes are
cities and edges are roads connecting them. The graph is undirected, because one can drive a road in
both directions. The weight of an edge will be the altitude of the highest point of the corresponding
road. The altitudes are given in meters.
There is necessarily no direct road connecting a pair of cities. The cities are numbered with
consecutive integers starting from 1, where 1 is always Kâ€™s home city and thus the origin of the
route. For example, in the following network of 7 cities"
